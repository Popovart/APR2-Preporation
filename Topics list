1. Pre-Columbian Era (Before 1492)

   Time before European explorers arrived in North America. During this period, the land was inhabited by Indigenous peoples who developed diverse societies, traditions, and ways of life adapted to their environment. Major tribes:

   - **Iroquois (political alliance)**: Lived in the Northeastern Woodlands, formed alliance (known as Iroquois Confederacy, including Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes) that influenced early democratic ideas.
   - **Cherokee**: Inhabited the Southeastern U.S., skilled in agriculture and known for their sophisticated social structure and written language.

2. Age of Exploration and Early Colonization (1492–1607)

   - Columbus’s voyages: Columbus’s first voyage (1492) with the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria led to the discovery of the San Salvador  (now Bahamas) and exploration of Cuba and Haiti. Later voyages (1493–1504) focused on exploring and colonizing new territories, despite tensions with native peoples and European settlers.
   - Exploration by Spain, France, and England: Spain focused on Central and South America, establishing vast empires and extracting resources. France explored the northern parts of North America, focusing on fur trade and alliances with Native Americans. England began exploring North America's eastern coast, laying the groundwork for future colonies.

These interactions significantly impacted Indigenous societies, bringing new goods like metal tools and horses, spreading diseases that reduced populations, and shifting control over land and resources.
