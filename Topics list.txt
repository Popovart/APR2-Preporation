1. Pre-Columbian Era (Before 1492)

   Time before European explorers arrived in North America. During this period, the land was inhabited by Indigenous peoples who developed diverse societies, traditions, and ways of life adapted to their environment. Major tribes:

   - **Iroquois (political alliance)**: Lived in the Northeastern Woodlands, formed alliance (known as Iroquois Confederacy, including Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes) that influenced early democratic ideas.
   - **Cherokee**: Inhabited the Southeastern U.S., skilled in agriculture and known for their sophisticated social structure and written language.
   - **Sioux**: Lived on the Great Plains, relied on buffalo for food, clothing, and tools, and were known for their nomadic lifestyle.
   - **Pueblo**: Resided in the Southwest, built homes in cliffs and used advanced irrigation techniques for farming.
   - **Apache**: Also in the Southwest, known for their warrior culture and adaptability to desert life.

2. Age of Exploration and Early Colonization (1492–1607)

   - Columbus’s voyages: Columbus’s first voyage (1492) with the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria led to the discovery of the San Salvador  (now Bahamas) and exploration of Cuba and Haiti. Later voyages (1493–1504) focused on exploring and colonizing new territories, despite tensions with native peoples and European settlers.
   - Exploration by Spain, France, and England: Spain focused on Central and South America, establishing vast empires and extracting resources. France explored the northern parts of North America, focusing on fur trade and alliances with Native Americans. England began exploring North America's eastern coast, laying the groundwork for future colonies.
   - First contact with Native Americans: Initial encounters between Europeans and Native Americans involved trade, cultural exchanges, and often conflict. These interactions significantly impacted Indigenous societies, bringing new goods like metal tools and horses, spreading diseases that reduced populations, and shifting control over land and resources.

3. St. Augustine (1565)

   The Spanish founded St. Augustine in 1565 in what is now Florida. It is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in North America. St. Augustine served as a key Spanish military and trade outpost, solidifying Spain's presence in the region.

4. Roanoke Colony (1587)

   The British first attempted colonization in 1587 on Roanoke Island. Harsh conditions and lack of supplies led to its failure, and by 1590, the colony was abandoned, earning it the name "The Lost Colony."

	- **Challenges in the Netherlands:**
		- **While they enjoyed religious liberty, the Pilgrims faced significant issues:**
			- Economic Hardship: Many worked in low-paying textile jobs and lived in poverty.
			- Cultural Concerns: Their children began assimilating into Dutch culture, and they feared losing their English identity.
			- Instability: The looming Thirty Years’ War and the end of a truce between Spain and the Dutch Republic made life in Leiden increasingly uncertain.
	- **Decision to Migrate to America:**
		- The Pilgrims sought to establish a self-governed community where they could freely practice their religion, improve their economic prospects, and preserve their culture.

		- By spring 1621, only about half of the original 102 passengers survived.
	- **Help from Native Americans:**
		- In spring 1621, a Native American named Samoset introduced the Pilgrims to Squanto, who taught them how to farm, fish, and hunt.
		- This cooperation allowed the settlement to flourish, and the Pilgrims formed an alliance with the Wampanoag tribe.
	- **Impact of Plymouth Colony:**
		- Plymouth became a foundation for later colonial endeavors in Massachusetts, setting a precedent for self-governance with the signing of the Mayflower Compact.
		- It also shaped the culture of New England and contributed to the ideals of religious freedom and community values in America.

- **Conflict Between Pennsylvania and Maryland (1730s–1767):**
	- The conflict between Pennsylvania and Maryland arose in the 1730s due to unclear and overlapping colonial boundaries. Both colonies claimed the same land, leading to disputes and even violent clashes between settlers. The dispute was finally resolved in 1767 with the surveying and establishment of the Mason-Dixon Line, which became the official border between the two colonies and later a symbolic dividing line between the North and the South.

- **Spanish Colonies in North America:**
	The Spanish played a significant role in shaping early North America during the colonial period, establishing settlements and influencing culture in regions that are now part of the United States. They focused on spreading Catholicism, developing trade, and securing territorial claims.

	- **Florida**:
	Spain established St. Augustine (1565), the first permanent European settlement in North America, as a military and trade outpost. It solidified Spanish control in the southeast.
	- **Texas**:
	In the 1700s, Spanish missions and presidios were built to secure the region and counter French expansion. The area became central to Spain's defense strategy in the Americas.
	- **New Mexico**:
	Colonization began in 1598, with Santa Fe (1610) becoming a key settlement. Spanish efforts focused on missionary work and trade, though Native American resistance, such as the Pueblo Revolt (1680), posed challenges.
	- **California**:
	Colonized in the late 1700s, Spain built missions along the Pacific coast to convert Native Americans and assert territorial control. Settlements like San Diego and Los Angeles originated during this time.

- **Dutch Influence in North America:**
	The Dutch established the colony of New Netherland in the early 17th century, focused on fur trade and centered around present-day New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Its main port, New Amsterdam (now New York City), became a key hub for trade. The Dutch lost control of the colony to the British after the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1664) and finally in the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1674). Despite this, Dutch cultural and economic practices influenced the region's development.
